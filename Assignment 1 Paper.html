<p>Towards the beginning of Limbo, the giant spider is first seen partially hidden behind a tree.</p>

<p>Ex. 1: The first appearance of the spider</p>

<p>The first appearance of the spider was particularly impactful because it was the first time something overtly malevolent was introduced in the game. Prior to this, there were no real “enemies”. To me, this had a great effect because it gave what was already a creepy atmosphere an actual feeling of danger. This could be interpreted as a crossing-over point from how Freud defines anxiety to how he defines fear: “ 'Anxiety' describes a particular state of expecting the danger or preparing for it, even though it may be an unknown one. 'Fear' requires a definite object of which to be afraid.” (Freud <i>Beyond the Pleasure Principle</i> 12). The subsequent sections after the first encounter with the spider deal with evading and defeating it. The spider is a clear object of fear during this time, and it created a great contrast from the previous sections where the atmosphere of the game is more anxious than fearful. However, leaving the spider partially obscured by the tree still leaves some air of anxiety, since the player still doesn't have a complete idea of what the spider is. Its full form and nature is revealed incrementally as the game progresses.
